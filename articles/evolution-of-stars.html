                    <p>
                        Stars are among the most significant and fundamental components of the universe. 
                    Their formation, evolution, and eventual death shape the motion and fate of celestial 
                    objects such as planets and galaxies. Understanding stellar evolution is crucial for comprehending 
                    the broader mechanisms governing the universe. By studying how stars change over time and the possible outcomes of their evolution, astronomers can gain insight into the life cycles of celestial bodies and their impact on cosmic structures.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like all natural phenomena, stars originate from fundamental building blocks—particles, 
                        dust, and gas—within giant molecular clouds. Gravitational forces act upon these clouds,
                         pulling material together and initiating a self-sustaining process of collapse and condensation.
                          This leads to the formation of a protostar, an early stage in stellar evolution where matter
                           accumulates, and nuclear fusion begins. The initial mass and density of the nebula determine the star’s evolutionary path, as greater mass results in stronger gravitational forces, ultimately influencing the star’s fate.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This report will explore stellar evolution using Altair as a case study. 
                        Altair is the brightest star in the northern constellation Aquila and the 12th brightest star in the night sky. 
                        By examining its formation, lifecycle, 
                        and ultimate fate, we can better understand the principles governing stellar evolution.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Evolution of Stars on The Example of Altair.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The initial mass of a nebula is a key factor in determining the formation and evolution of a star.
                         A larger mass leads to a stronger gravitational pull, causing the nebula to collapse more rapidly. 
                         This accelerated collapse generates higher temperatures and pressures, expediting the onset of nuclear
                          fusion. The mass of a star also dictates whether it can overcome electron and neutron degeneracy pressures, which resist further collapse. If a star’s remaining mass exceeds 1.4 times the Sun’s mass (the Chandrasekhar limit), it will collapse into a neutron star. If it surpasses 3 solar masses, it will form a black hole. This significant value was named after indian-born astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who formulated it in 1930, using principles of quantum physics and Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity. He showed that it is impossible for white dwarf to stay stable if its mass is greater than 1.44 solar masses. Therefore, a star’s lifetime and final fate depend largely on its initial mass.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a medium-mass star, Altair likely formed from a dense molecular cloud in the Aquila constellation, 
                        with a total mass of approximately 6–8 solar masses. Gravity pulled together gas, dust, and other 
                        particles, leading to the formation of a hot, dense core. Given Altair’s classification as an 
                        A-type main-sequence star, this process likely occurred over a few million years. Once enough mass was accumulated, Altair's core reached the temperature and pressure required to initiate hydrogen fusion, marking its transition into a main-sequence star.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, Altair is in its main-sequence phase, where it is primarily fusing hydrogen into helium. 
                        In the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, white Altair is classified as an A-type main-sequence star, positioned alongside Sirius and Procyon. The HR diagram is a crucial tool in astronomy, allowing scientists to classify stars, track their evolution, and estimate the age of star clusters. As stars exhaust their hydrogen supply, they expand, cool, and become more luminous, transitioning into the red giant phase. The location where a star moves off the main sequence provides insight into the age of stellar populations, as more massive stars evolve more quickly than their lower-mass counterparts. 
                        This diagram was evolved from charts begun in 1911 by the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung and independently by the U.S. astronomer Henry Norris Russell.

                    <div class = "img">
                        <img src = "../img/hp-diagram.jpg">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        For example, low-mass stars, such as red dwarfs (M or K-type), have lifespans extending into trillions of years—far longer than the current age of the universe—meaning their full evolutionary paths remain unobserved. In contrast, Altair, as a medium-mass star, will undergo significant changes over hundreds of millions of years. If its initial mass had been less than 0.08 solar masses, it would have remained a brown dwarf, never initiating hydrogen fusion. Such stars are called brown dwarfs, and are barely visible for a human eye, as they are small and emit a relatively small amount of light. That is why infrared is used in order to study these celestial bodies. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As 1.86 solar masses Altair ages, it will diminish its hydrogen supply, causing its outer layers to expand and cool, transforming it into a red giant. This phase is represented in the upper-right quadrant of the HR diagram. The weaker gravitational pull on the expanded outer layers will cause them to blow off, eventually forming a planetary nebula. Meanwhile, the core will contract further, becoming hot enough for helium fusion, which will produce carbon. However, Altair lacks the mass required to undergo further fusion stages, as it cannot overcome electron degeneracy pressure. Consequently, it will not progress to carbon fusion but will instead leave behind a white dwarf.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final stage of stellar evolution depends on a star’s mass. Since Altair will become a white dwarf, we begin with this outcome. White dwarfs represent the remainder of medium-mass stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. Despite having a mass below 1.4 solar masses, white dwarfs are extremely dense, with a size comparable to Earth. This small surface area results in significant gravitational pressure, but not enough to overcome electron degeneracy pressure, which prevents further collapse. White dwarfs emit heat, with surface temperatures reaching approximately 100,000 K, and radiate in ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. Surrounding planetary nebulae contain expelled gas that, over time, may contribute to new star formation, continuing the stellar cycle.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For more massive stars, different evolutionary paths unfold. If a star's core mass exceeds 1.4 solar masses but remains below 3 solar masses, it can overcome electron degeneracy pressure, causing electrons and protons to merge into neutrons. This process releases vast amounts of energy and results in the formation of a neutron star. Neutron stars exhibit extreme gravitational forces, rapid rotation, and intense magnetic fields, making them one of the densest objects in the universe.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of the most massive stars, with mass exceeding 3 \[M☉]\, even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot resist gravitational collapse. The result is the formation of a black hole—a region of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape. Black holes profoundly influence their surroundings, warping spacetime and dictating the motion of nearby objects. The boundary beyond which nothing can return, known as the event horizon, marks the point of no return for matter and radiation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Altair will not undergo such extreme evolutionary paths, its eventual transformation into a white dwarf and the dispersal of its outer layers will contribute to the ongoing process of stellar formation and cosmic evolution.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All three ending fates play a significant role in astronomical research and universe development. As was mentioned earlier, white dwarfs are created along with planetary nebulae whose material can also contribute to the formation of new celestial objects, providing a “life” cycle in the universe. Moreover, the luminosity of white dwarfs can be used by astronomers to measure how long ago star formation began in a particular region, therefore making it an important tool to study history and evolution of our universe. As for neutron stars, recent research says that neutron star collisions are the universe’s main sources of heavy elements such as gold and uranium. Additionally, neutron stars are the densest objects that scientists can study and observe, because black holes are hidden by the event horizon, so we cannot see what is inside. Whereas black holes are the most mysterious objects that govern galaxies, as the core part of these systems.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Stellar evolution is primarily determined by a star’s initial mass, which influences its formation, nuclear fusion process, and final fate. Altair, a medium-mass A-type star, will eventually become a white dwarf, following the well-researched evolutionary path of similar stars. Additionally, the HR diagram is a valuable tool for tracking stellar evolution, classifying stars, and estimating the ages of star clusters. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The life cycles of stars shape the universe by producing and distributing essential elements over space. Moreover, the final stages of a star's evolution play a crucial role in universe formation and development. White dwarfs help determine the timeline of star formation, neutron star merges contribute to the creation of heavy elements, and black holes control galaxy dynamics. Studying these processes not only enhances our understanding of the universe’s history but also informs models predicting its future.

                    <p>
                        Several questions have occurred throughout the study that might suggest the potential topic for future research. One of the main ideas of the current paper is the contribution of mass in the evolutions of stars. Also, there has been a term of Chandrasekhar limit that basically states the boundaries for white dwarfs, but what factors do actually determine the limit? How exactly did Chandrasekhar find this value? In addition, since there are already 3 different forms of ending fate of a star, there might be a question: Why is there only three stages, and why is black hole final?

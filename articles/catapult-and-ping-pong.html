                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The kinematics problem of calculating the movement of a ping pong ball is not as trivial as the most school problems we are given at school. First of all, this case involves air drag, or air resistance, and doesn't leave it as something negligible. 
                        This means that there will be a force that opposes velocity and affects acceleration. Moreover, if we looked at the formula that describes this phenomenon:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        \[F_D = {{1\over{2}} \rho v^2C_DA}.\]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would notice that it contains velocity, meaning that it changes continuously as an object moves. Therefore, the acceleration is going to change, hence velocity. A question arises: how does acceleration change? In other words, 
                    is this change linear or quadratic? Let's leave this question for later. 
                    2.air resistance
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, the ping pong ball starts its flight by launching from catapult which makes a circular move involving force of tension from an elastic. Here, there are two main parts that require 
                        detailed approach: circular motion and force of tension; as they both affect the initial velocity the ping pong gets before a free flight. For force of tension we are going to use this fromula:
                        <p>
                            \[F_T = {-kx}.\]
                            \(k\) - is a string constant<br>
                            \(x\) - is a deformation of a string
                        </p>
                        centrepetal force and energy
                    </p>
                    <h2>First Failures</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning, the goal was to estimate \(d_y\) and \(d_x\). Then, it was decided to solve this problem without exact values, using only variables. First, \(d_y\) was an initial attempt solving this problem,
                        using only school currciulum knowledge. So, We started approaching it by drawing FBD of a ball before it reaches the highest point:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        As we can clearly see, in a \(y\)-axiswe have only two forces oppose each other. Therefore we can write an equation using Newton's Second Law:
                        \[-F_{Dy}-F_g=F_{net_y}\]
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make our calculations look more pleasent, we can change 4 contsants in the Air Drag formula to just one:
                        \[c_1={1\over{2}} \rho C_DA.\]
                        Then, our equation would look like that:
                        \[-v_y^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}\]
                        From here we can find our velocity at any point before it starts falling:
                        \[v_y = \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        Since we know that velocity is a derivative of displacement, we can take an integral of both sides:
                        \[\int_0^t v_y = \int_0^t \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1} \int_0^t \sqrt{-a_{y}-g}\]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3a_y\prime}} ((-a_y(t)-g)^{3\over2} - (-a_y(0)-g)^{3\over2}) \]
                        We are gettig a long formula with 3 unknowns: \(a_y\prime\), \(-a_y(t)\), and \(-a_y(0)\). For the final acceleration, we know that at the highest point its acceleration 
                        is equal to gravity, as velocity is zero, hence air drag. \(-a_y(0)\) can be find from the previou formula:
                        \[-v_y(0)^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}(0)\]
                        \[-v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}}-g=a_{y}(0)\]
                        However, whet it comes to finding a derivative of acceleration, we have to come up with some assumptions. Since this section is called "First Failures", we decided to assume that acceleration is changing constantly
                        meaning that the derivative of \(a_y\) is constant. With that idea in mind, we tried to made following mathematical movements:
                        \[(-v_y^2{c_1\over{m}}-g)\prime=a_{y}\prime\]
                        \[-2a_yv_y{c_1\over{m}}=a_{y}\prime\]
                        Since the \(a_y\prime\) is constant, we can take \(v_y(0) and a_y(0)\) as our numbers:
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3(-2a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (- (v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-1\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (v_y(0)^3({c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^3\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0))}}  \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^2\over{3(a_y(0))}}  \]
                        Looks really cool, doesn't it? That makes this reasoning more treacherous. Afterwards, it was time to think about \(\Delta d_x\), but it seemed that we would have to know time which was a hard work. Therefore computer teachnology was involved.

                        As a resulted, it was discovered that the crucial assumption was wrong, because a "simulation" was made where a computer changes acceleration and velocity according to physics laws. The results of those values are given below:

                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The kinematics problem of calculating the movement of a ping pong ball is not as trivial as most school problems we are given at school. 
                        First of all, this case involves air drag, or air resistance, and doesn't leave it as something negligible. 
                        This means that there will be a force that opposes velocity and affects acceleration. Moreover, if we looked at the formula that describes this phenomenon:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        \[F_D = {{1\over{2}} \rho v^2C_DA}.\]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would notice that it contains velocity, meaning it changes continuously as an object moves. Therefore, the acceleration is going to change, hence velocity. 
                        A question arises: how does acceleration change? In other words, is this change linear or quadratic? Let's leave this question for later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, the ping pong ball starts its flight by launching from a catapult which makes a circular move involving force of tension from an elastic. 
                        Here, two main parts require a detailed approach: circular motion and force of tension; as they both affect the initial velocity the ping pong gets before a free flight. 
                        For the force of tension, we are going to use this formula:<p>
                            \[F_T = {kx}.\]
                            \(k\) - is a string constant<br>
                            \(x\) - is a deformation of a string
                        </p>
                        So, spoiler, the launching velocity will be determined by using the energy of the elastics which involves the force of tension. 
                        Also, we have developed a simulation that estimates the motion of such a scenario. 
                        In order to make this thing, we decided to estimate the acceleration and velocity the catapult has at each point of time while it pushes upwards the ping pong ball by using centripetal speed, even though it is not a uniform motion. 
                        As for the centripetal force, it is going to be a component of the force of tension that aligns with the arm. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>First Failures</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the beginning, the goal was to estimateÂ \(d_y\) andÂ \(d_x\). 
                        Then, it was decided to solve this problem without exact values, using only variables. First,\(d_y\) was an initial attempt to solve this problem, using only school curriculum knowledge. So, We started approaching it by drawing the FBD of a ball before it reached the highest point:

                    <p>
                        As we can see, in a \(y\)-axis we have only two forces opposing each other. Therefore we can write an equation using Newton's Second Law:
                        \[-F_{Dy}-F_g=F_{net_y}\]
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make our calculations look more pleasant, we can change 4 constants in the Air Drag formula to just one:
                        \[c_1={1\over{2}} \rho C_DA.\]
                        Then, our equation would look like this:
                        \[-v_y^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}\]
                        From here we can find our velocity at any point before it starts falling:
                        \[v_y = \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        Since we know that velocity is a derivative of displacement, we can take an integral of both sides:
                        \[\int_0^t v_y = \int_0^t \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1} \int_0^t \sqrt{-a_{y}-g}\]
                        Since this section is called "First Failures", we decided to assume that acceleration changes constantly
                        meaning that the derivative of \(a_y\) is constant:
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3a_y\prime}} ((-a_y(t)-g)^{3\over2} - (-a_y(0)-g)^{3\over2}) \]
                        We are gettig a long formula with 3 unknowns: \(a_y\prime\), \(-a_y(t)\), and \(-a_y(0)\). For the final acceleration, we know that at the highest point, its acceleration 
 is equal to gravity, as velocity is zero, hence air drag. \(-a_y(0)\) can be found from the previous formula:
                        \[-v_y(0)^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}(0)\]
                        \[-v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}}-g=a_{y}(0)\]
                        However, when it comes to finding a derivative of acceleration, we have to come up with some assumptions. It was already mentioned that we assume that the derivative of the acceleration remains unchanged. With that idea in mind, we tried to make the following mathematical movements:
                        \[(-v_y^2{c_1\over{m}}-g)\prime=a_{y}\prime\]
                        \[-2a_yv_y{c_1\over{m}}=a_{y}\prime\]
                        Since the \(a_y\prime\) is constant, we can take \(v_y(0) and a_y(0)\) as our numbers:
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3(-2a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (- (v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-1\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (v_y(0)^3({c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^3\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0))}} Â \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^2\over{3(a_y(0))}} Â \]
                        Looks cool, doesn't it? That makes this reasoning more treacherous. Afterward, it was time to think about \(\Delta d_x\), but it seemed that we would have to know time which was hard work. Therefore computer technology was involved.

                    <p>
                        As a result, it was discovered that the crucial assumption was wrong, because a "simulation" was made where a computer changes acceleration and velocity according to physics laws. The results of those values are given below:

                        <h2>Next Findings</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, we came up with some good reasoning. As was mentioned before, we decided to develop a simulation of a ping-pong ball that launches from a catapult. Also, a "calculator" was made in order to estimate values and resolve some issues.
                            One of the things we wanted to know was the initial velocity of the free flight. After trial and error, an interesting idea was found. Here, a concept of energy was used, to be specific, conservation of energy:
                            \[K_1 + U_1 = K_2 + U_2\]
                            The most famous types of energy at school are kinetic and gravitational potential energy. However, an elastic is involved, meaning that it is going to commit some work. This work is going to transform into kinetic and gravitational energies at the final point.
                            What is a work though? By definition, we can find it using this formula:
                            \[W = F\Delta d\]
                            Since we know that Tension can be found according to the Hooke's law:
                            \[F_T=-kx\]
                            However, there is a problem: F_T changes as the catapult's arm moves and shortens the spring's length. Therefore, we have to calculate \(W\) at an infinitely short point in time. Or take an integral!
                            But how? Well, we can plot the F vs d graph, where F is a force at a certain d traveled, to imagine this scenario:

                            And it does make sense because the force would .....
                            Since integral is an area under the curve, we can find an area of this triangle, which would be:
                            \[W = {kl^2\over 2}\]
                            Turns out this is called elastic potential energy! Thus, we can put this work as a potential energy into the conservation of energy law along with final gravitational and kinetic energies:
                            \[{kl^2\over 2} = {mv^2\over 2}+ mgh\]
                            Here we are! Now we can easily find velocity:
                            \[v = \sqrt{{kl^2\over m}-2gh}\]

                        </p>

                        <h3>1.Main approach</h3>
                        <p> To simulate the ball's physics, an object is created to store four vectors:<br>
                            <p>     
                            1. Position.<br>
                            2. Net force.<br>
                            3. Net acceleration.<br>
                            4. Net Velocity.<br>
                            </p>
                            At the first frame of the simulation, all vectors are undefined except for velocity, which is set to a target value.  
                            In each frame, a drag force is calculated and added to the constant force of gravity, resulting in the net force vector for the ball.<br>
                            The net force is then divided by the ballâ€™s mass, producing the net acceleration.<br>
                            This acceleration is added to the net velocity, and finally, the updated velocity is added to the position vector at the end of each physics frame.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. I love and hate rendering</h3>
                        For me, creating the physics simulation was much simpler than rendering it. All results are stored in SI unitsâ€”meters, kilograms, and seconds.  
                        Because of this, 1 pixel on the screen corresponded to 1 meter, making the simulation appear underwhelming. If the ball moved 10 meters, it only moved 10 pixels on the screen (unless its initial speed was set to something extreme like 1 km/s).  
                        To fix this, I scaled everything by 100 so that 1 pixel corresponded to 1 cm. However, this change broke the camera that was supposed to follow the ball's movement.  
                        Even though I applied the scaling correctly, the camera behaved as if it was scaled ten times as much.  
                        Fortunately, rendering works independently of physics, so messing up one part didnâ€™t break the other.  
                        It turned out I had scaled the camera correctly, but I hadnâ€™t scaled the ballâ€™s position XD.  
                        Anyway this whole chapter is just me venting about how counterintuitive rendering can be. For example, to make a camera follow something, you donâ€™t actually move the cameraâ€”you shift everything else in the opposite direction. I HATE IT.
                        <h3>3. Time problems</h3> 
                        Even after fixing the scale, the simulation still felt off. Having a realistic scale is pointless if the ball reaches its destination in less than a second.  
                        To address this, we implemented a slow-motion effect. At first, we simply scaled down every vector, but we quickly realized that this scaling affected, everything linearly but, some parts of the simulation change not linearly,
                        that way the result was changing depenging on the time scale. This wouldn't work. So we came up with another solution! Instead of slowing everything down, the program precalculates ball trajectory before displaying it. So now we can controll how fast the ball is moving without affecting physics part of it.

                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The kinematics problem of calculating the movement of a ping pong ball is not as trivial as the most school problems we are given at school. First of all, this case involves air drag, or air resistance, and doesn't leave it as something negligible. 
                        This means that there will be a force that opposes velocity and affects acceleration. Moreover, if we looked at the formula that describes this phenomenon:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        \[F_D = {{1\over{2}} \rho v^2C_DA}.\]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would notice that it contains velocity, meaning that it changes continuously as an object moves. Therefore, the acceleration is going to change, hence velocity. A question arises: how does acceleration change? In other words, 
                    is this change linear or quadratic? Let's leave this question for later. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, the ping pong ball starts its flight by launching from catapult which makes a circular move involving force of tension from an elastic. Here, there are two main parts that require 
                        detailed approach: circular motion and force of tension; as they both affect the initial velocity the ping pong gets before a free flight. For force of tension we are going to use this fromula:
                        <p>
                            \[F_T = {-kx}.\]
                            \(k\) - is a string constant<br>
                            \(x\) - is a deformation of a string
                        </p>
                        So, spoiler, the launching velocity is going to be determined by using energy of the elastics which involves the force of tension. Also, we have developed a simulation that estimates the motion of such a scenario.
                        In order to make this thing, we decided to estimate the acceleration and velocity the catapult has at each point of time while it pushes upwards the ping pong ball by using centrapetal speed, even thoung it is not a uniform motion. 
                        As for the centrapital force, it is going to be a component of the force of tension that aligns with the arm. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>First Failures</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning, the goal was to estimate \(d_y\) and \(d_x\). Then, it was decided to solve this problem without exact values, using only variables. First, \(d_y\) was an initial attempt solving this problem,
                        using only school currciulum knowledge. So, We started approaching it by drawing FBD of a ball before it reaches the highest point:

                    <p>
                        As we can clearly see, in a \(y\)-axiswe have only two forces oppose each other. Therefore we can write an equation using Newton's Second Law:
                        \[-F_{Dy}-F_g=F_{net_y}\]
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make our calculations look more pleasent, we can change 4 contsants in the Air Drag formula to just one:
                        \[c_1={1\over{2}} \rho C_DA.\]
                        Then, our equation would look like that:
                        \[-v_y^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}\]
                        From here we can find our velocity at any point before it starts falling:
                        \[v_y = \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        Since we know that velocity is a derivative of displacement, we can take an integral of both sides:
                        \[\int_0^t v_y = \int_0^t \sqrt{m(a_{y}+g)\over -c_1}\]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1} \int_0^t \sqrt{-a_{y}-g}\]
                        Since this section is called "First Failures", we decided to assume that acceleration is changing constantly
                        meaning that the derivative of \(a_y\) is constant:
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3a_y\prime}} ((-a_y(t)-g)^{3\over2} - (-a_y(0)-g)^{3\over2}) \]
                        We are gettig a long formula with 3 unknowns: \(a_y\prime\), \(-a_y(t)\), and \(-a_y(0)\). For the final acceleration, we know that at the highest point its acceleration 
                        is equal to gravity, as velocity is zero, hence air drag. \(-a_y(0)\) can be find from the previou formula:
                        \[-v_y(0)^2c_1-mg=ma_{y}(0)\]
                        \[-v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}}-g=a_{y}(0)\]
                        However, whet it comes to finding a derivative of acceleration, we have to come up with some assumptions. It was already meantioned that we assume that derivative of the acceleration remains unchanged. With that idea in mind, we tried to made following mathematical movements:
                        \[(-v_y^2{c_1\over{m}}-g)\prime=a_{y}\prime\]
                        \[-2a_yv_y{c_1\over{m}}=a_{y}\prime\]
                        Since the \(a_y\prime\) is constant, we can take \(v_y(0) and a_y(0)\) as our numbers:
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-2\over{3(-2a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (- (v_y(0)^2{c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = \sqrt{m\over c_1}{-1\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0){c_1\over{m}})}} (v_y(0)^3({c_1\over{m}})^{3\over2}) \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^3\over{3(a_y(0)v_y(0))}}  \]
                        \[\Delta d_y = {-v_y(0)^2\over{3(a_y(0))}}  \]
                        Looks really cool, doesn't it? That makes this reasoning more treacherous. Afterwards, it was time to think about \(\Delta d_x\), but it seemed that we would have to know time which was a hard work. Therefore computer teachnology was involved.

                    <p>
                        As a resulted, it was discovered that the crucial assumption was wrong, because a "simulation" was made where a computer changes acceleration and velocity according to physics laws. The results of those values are given below:

                        <h2>Next Findings</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, we came up with some good reasoning. As was mentioned before, we decided to develop a simulation of a ping pong ball that launches from a catapult. Also, a "calculator" was made in order to estimate values and resolve some issues.
                            One of the thing we wanted to know was an initial velocity of the free flight. After trial and error, an interesting idea was found. Here, a concept of energy was used, to be specific, conservation of energy:
                            \[K_1 + U_1 = K_2 + U_2\]
                            The most famous types of energies at school are kinetic and gravitational potential energy. However, an elastic is involved, meaning that it is going to commit some work. This work is going to transform into kinetic and gravitational energiesat the final point.
                            What is a work though? By definition, we can found it using this formula:
                            \[W = F\Delta d\]
                            Since we know that Tension can be found according to the Hooke's law:
                            \[F_T=-kx\]
                            However, there is a problem: F_T changes as the catapult's arm moves and shortnes the spring's length. Therefore, we have to calculate \(W\) at ach infinitaly short point of time. Or take an integral!
                            But how? Well, we can plot F vs d graph, where F is a force at a certain d traveled, to imagine this scenario:

                            And it does make sense, because the force would .....
                            Since integral is an area under the curve, we can find an area of this triangle, which would be:
                            \[W = {kl^2\over 2}\]
                            Turns out this is called elastic potential energy! Thus, we can put this work as a potential energy into the conservaton of energy law along with final gravitational and kinetic energies:
                            \[{kl^2\over 2} = {mv^2\over 2}+ mgh\]
                            Here we are! Now we can easily find velocity:
                            \[v = \sqrt{{kl^2\over m}-2gh}\]

                        </p>

                        <h3>1.Main approach</h3>
                        <p>To simulate the physics of the ball, the object is created which stores 4 vectors.<br>
                            <p>     
                            1. Position.<br>
                            2. Net force.<br>
                            3. Net acceleration.<br>
                            4. Net Velocity.<br>
                            </p>
                            Every vector is undefined at the first frame of the simulation, but the velocity, as it is set to a target value.
                            Then each frame a force of drag is calculated, added to the constant force of gravity and the resultant is set as a net froce vector for the ball.<br>
                            Next, the net force is devided by the mass of the ball and the result is set as the net acceleration for the ball. <br>
                            After acceleration is found, it is added to the net velocity and finally at the end of the physics frame velocity is added to the position vector.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. I love and hate rendering</h3>
                            For me create physics simulation was much simpler then render it. First of all, All results are stored in CI units, in this case it was meters, kilograms
                            and second. Because of this 1 pixel on the screen corresponded to 1 meter, so the simulation wasn't spectecular at all. When ball moved 10 meters, on the screen it only moved 10 pixels (unless you set its initial speed to 1 km/s)...
                            this meant that i need to scale everything by 100 to make 1 pixel correspond to 1 cm. But now the camera that followed ball's movement 
                            were broken. Even though i scaled it correctly it behaved as if it was scaled ten times as much. Fortunetly, rendering works independently of the physics so 
                            me messing up one part wouldn't break the other. In the end it turned out that i scaled the camera correctly but i didn't scale the ball's position XD.
                            Any way this chapter is just me crying about how counter-intuitive the renderin is. For example to make camera follow something, you dont need to actually move the camera
                            but rather shift everything opposite to the camera. I HATE IT.
                        <h3>3. Time problems</h3> 
                            Well, when the scale was fixed, the simulation still sucked. Who needs normal scale when the time in which the ball arrives is less than a second.
                            To fix it we decided to implement slow motion effect. Firstly, we just scaled every vector down by a bit, but soon we realized that now this scale affects
